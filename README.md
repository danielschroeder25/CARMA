### Overview
CARMA is our communication-optimal parallel recursive rectangular matrix multiplication algorithm. We use Cilk Plus for the parallelism, and MKL for the base-case multiplication. Research in progress: [paper](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-205.pdf), [poster](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~odedsc/papers/CARMA%20Poster-SC12).

### Setup
Define all parameters at the top of `run.sh`.

### Usage
```
./run.sh
```

Then check ```data.csv``` for the results.

### Notes
*  To maintain simplicity, we don't handle the case where the largest dimension is not divisible by two. Therefore, to be safe, please only use multipes of sufficiently large powers of two.
*  The most interesting results are generated by "dot-product-like" dimensions, for example m = n = 64, k = 2^20 (we are multiplying an m x k matrix by a k x n matrix, and the result is m x n).
*  For faster trials, ensure that the correctness test at the bottom of `data_gatherer` is commented.

### Requirements
You must have Intel Parallel Studio XE installed, which will provide Cilk Plus and MKL.
